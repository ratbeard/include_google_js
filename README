IncludeGoogleJs
===============

Allows you to easily use Google's hosted javascript libraries instead of your own copies, lightening the load for your server and for your visitors.

IncludeGoogleJs will override javascript_include_tag to use Google's hosted Javascript libraries instead of the local copies, as explained at 
http://ajaxian.com/archives/announcing-ajax-libraries-api-speed-up-your-ajax-apps-with-googles-infrastructure
and announced at
http://googleajaxsearchapi.blogspot.com/2008/05/speed-up-access-to-your-favorite.html

Acts like the regular javascript_include_tag, but adds :include_google_js and :version options.
Gets the requested files and swaps out any that Google hosts.
Checks for a working connection to ajax.googleapis.com before switching over.

Versions are based on the version running locally, or can be overridden by passing :versions => {:scriptaculous => "1.5", :jquery => "1.3.2"}.

Should work with Rails > 2.0.

Thanks to Brian Hogan and Jose Fernandez for their help.
